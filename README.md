# Blackjack
A Blackjack game for practice!

Hi to anyone who see's this. This is my first OOP Python program, it is unfinished.

What is working so far:

I have 3 (well 4) but 3 classes. Card, Deck, Player and Dealer.
They all seem to work well for now. Dealer is a sub-class of player. This is for the game logic to differentiate from Player()
So far the game add's shuffled cards to a shoe. The game will then deal 2 cards to each player including the dealer (which will have one card face down).

That's it so far.
