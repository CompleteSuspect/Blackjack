# Blackjack
A Blackjack game for practice!

Hi to anyone who sees this. This is my first OOP Python program, it is finally finished and mostly working!

A few things that you might find odd:

Each player can have multiple hands, this is so a player can split a hand.
Based on this logic I've decided that the class Deck() will keep track of bids rather than the Player() class, think of it as the player will place a bid ON a hand.
Same applies to the score attribute on class Deck() each hand will have it's own score rather than a player having a score.

Again, this is to make it easier to handle split hands.

A player can split a hand as many times as possible with no restriction, also split hands can have a 'natural' blackjack win.

There are a few extra things I could've added, such as an option to Surrender or the shoe having a plastic instert which signifies a reshuffle (this still happens when the shoe is empty though). I've spent far too long on this and it's time to move on.

This has been good practice and I've enjoyed the challenge.
